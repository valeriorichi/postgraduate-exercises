            <h2>Welcome to the Front End Tech Tests!</h2>
            <p>This is the repo where you can hone your skills and sharpen your teeth on some problems you might face in an interview</p>
            <p>We have given you 6 challenges that you can try. We suggest you build a new React App to try building these problems.</p>
            <p>Each test demonstrates how the solution should function, how you build it is up to you, but it must have the core functionality that has been asked for!</p>
            <p>In order, the tests are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Build a Log In Page,</li>
                <li>Build a Movie Search Bar,</li>
                <li>Create a "Name the 50 US States" Game,</li>
                <li>Create a "Find the X" Game,</li>
                <li>Build a Drop Down Menu,</li>
                <li>Build an Pseudo Instant Messaging Service</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you feel comfortable enough, try implementing the challenge section of each test!</p>
            <p>They're harder than they appear...</p>
            <p>Have fun and best of luck in your interviews!</p>
