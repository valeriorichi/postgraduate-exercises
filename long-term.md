# Long-term projects
---


## **Deliverables**

The following are required for each project:

1. Source control via GitHub, and a sharable Repo that you'd be proud to show potential employers.
2. Take special account for accessibility issues
3. Instructions on how to run/build the app should be documented in a README.
4. Error Handling.
5. Test Driven Development.
6. Bonus points for hosting.

### **Technology**

These are intended to be longer-term tasks, so try to treat each one like you would on a live dev team. The technologies learned during your time on the course should be enough to complete the below, but consider spiking alternatives if you'd like to broaden your horizons and see what else is possible.

### **Estimated time to complete**

We'd recommend spending at least a week on each of these projects, but really "how long is a pieceOf.toString()?" Once you've worked through the initial requirements, feel free to make your project into whatever you dare to dream... Thought of another feature? Pop it in. Spotted something you could refactor to make your codebase EVEN more beautiful? Be our guest! Ready to move onto something different? Fair enough, you crack on...

## **Can we build it? Yes we KANBAN**

A Trello-style project management board to manage all of your important code tasks now you're a fully-fledged developer.

---

### **Long description**

**Requirements**

We're going full-stack with this one. You'll need yourself a RESTful API and a good-looking front-end that'll allow you to do the following:

1. Create a kanban-style todo list app:

   - This should allow users to add, delete, move and update tickets.
   - Each ticket added should provide an overview of the task at hand. When the user clicks into a ticket, they should be able to see more detailed information regarding that task.
   - Think about what the user will see when they complete each of the above actions, what would be a positive user experience, and what information would be useful to include?
   - Tickets should be colour-coded, dependent on their urgency.

2. Create different workspaces to group different lists together:

   - A user should be able to keep their (for example) work and personal todo lists separate. There is no limit to how many lists may be in each workspace, nor how many workspaces a user may have.

---

**Extension**

1. Allow users to invite others to share and collaborate on lists.
   - Think about the best way to facilitate this so that multiple users can interact with the same page in real-time.
   - How will users be notified of their invitation to contribute?
   - Will each user account be password-protected? How are we going to keep things secure?
     - What will happen if someone who doesn't have an account tries to view our list?
     - What if someone has an account but hasn't been invited to contribute to our list?

## **Habit Tracker**

Apparently (we googled) it takes 21 days to form a new habit, and 90 days for that new habit to become a permanent fixture in your lifestyle. We want you to build an online portal where users can form and track habits, with insight into their journey, and encouragement to keep going.

---

### **Long description**

**Requirements**

We're going full-stack with this one. You'll need yourself a RESTful API and a good-looking front-end that'll allow your users to do the following:

1. Declare a new habit they would like to form, and track how it's going. This may include any combination of the following:
   - A "daily check-in" feature.
   - A visualisation of how many days they have completed so far, and how many are left until the next milestone.
   - A forum to discuss their journey with like-minded habit forgers.
   - A notice board of motivational articles.
   - A tracker to record and review how much time they have spent working on their habit.
   - A badge-based reward system. Checked-in every day for a week? Here, have a virtual medal.

---

**Extension**

- Let's get personal. Find a way to customise the content (articles, forum pages etc) that your user sees in the platform, based on the nature of the habit they're trying to forge.
- Allow users to add each other as "friends". Friends should be able to see the progress that their friends are making, and comment on each other's achievements.

## **Shopkeeper**

Build your empire with an online shop to sell teapots/corned beef/lizards/whatever you want.

---

### **Long description**

**Requirements**

We're going full-stack with this one. You'll need yourself a RESTful API and a good-looking front-end that'll allow for the following:

1. Users can peruse, search and filter all of the items that you have on offer.

2. You can see how many of each item you currently have in stock. Items that are out of stock will be flagged as such to the user.

3. Users can add and remove items to/from their baskets.

   - For this one, we really want you to think about how to persist your data. Oh my! There's someone at the door. Do I want my items to still be in my basket when I come back in ten minutes? Probably. But if items are in my basket, that means other people can't buy them. When (and how) do you say "enough's enough!" and put it all back on the (virtual) shelf?

4. Some sort of checkout transaction for customers to purchase their items.

   - We wouldn't advise trying to get real-life money changing hands here unless you're actually going to start a business. There's a lot of standards you have to meet and administration to go through. This is really more of a "proof of concept" project. That in mind, probably best to steer away from asking for any sensitive information here.

5. A "best sellers" and "new-in" section which automatically updates depending on which products are most popular/ recently added.

6. A user profile with an order-history rundown.

---

**Extension**

- A live-chat feature for users to interact with you directly about any products, concerns, compliments, thoughts, catchy-jingles they have in mind.
