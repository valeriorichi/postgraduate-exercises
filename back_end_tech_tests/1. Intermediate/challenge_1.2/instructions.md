# 1.2 Are these Numbers Co-Prime?
In maths, a prime number is a number that is only divisible by itself and 1 (e.g. 13 is only divisible by 13 and 1).

Co-Primes are 2 numbers such that their only common divisor is 1. For example, 9 and 20 are co-prime, no divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10 and 20) go perfectly into the other except 1.

Notice that neither 9 or 20 are prime themselves. This means that the numbers we choose don't have to be prime for them to be co-prime. But it does help if one number is prime.

100 and 756 on the other hand aren't co-prime because 2 divides both with no remainder (100/2 = 50, 756/2 = 378).

But, 100 and 111 are co-prime because 100 is divisible only by 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50 and 100 whereas 111 is only divisible by 1, 3, 37, and 111. Thus, the only 2 numbers in both lists that are a factor of both 100 and 111 is 1. Hence, 100 and 111 are co-prime.

## Task:
We want to find out if any 2 numbers are co-prime. Are 100,453 and 3,417 co-prime? What about these numbers: 81, 11,111,111? Are they co-prime?

Write a function that will return true if the numbers are co-prime and false if they aren't.
