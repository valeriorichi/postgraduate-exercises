# 1.3 Difference to Next Fibonacci Number
I'm sure you've heard of the Fibonacci sequence. It's the set of numbers that you get when you add the two previous numbers in the sequence you get your next number. This sequence starts of with the numbers 0 & 1, giving us the following sequence:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

This is the Fibonacci sequence that we all know and love.

## Task:
Our task is, given any number, find the difference between that number and the first Fibonacci number greater than our given number.

For example, given a number, 10, we want our function to return 3. This is because 13 is the first Fibonacci number that is greater than 10, thus 13 - 10 = 3.

If the given number is a Fibonacci number, return 0;
